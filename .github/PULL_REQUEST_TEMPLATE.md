### Pull Request Checklist

* [ ] Pull request includes a [changelog file](https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog). The entry should:
  - Be a short description of your change which makes sense to users. "Fix a bug that prevented receiving messages from other servers." instead of "Move X method from `EventStore` to `EventWorkerStore`.".
  - Include 'Contributed by *Your Name*.' or 'Contributed by @*your-github-username*.' â€” unless you would prefer not to be credited in the changelog.
  - Use markdown where necessary, mostly for `code blocks`.
  - End with either a period (.) or an exclamation mark (!).
  - Start with a capital letter.
* [ ] Pull request includes a [sign off](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-off)
