Security Fixes
--------------
 * Ensures that authentication tokens are generated using a secure random number
   generator, ensuring they cannot be predicted by an attacker. Thanks to @opnsec
   for identifying and responsibly disclosing the issue!
 * Mitigate an HTML injection bug where an invalid room_id could result in
   malicious HTML being injected into validation emails. Thanks to @opnsec
   for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue too!
 * Randomise session_ids to avoid leaking info about the total number of
   identity validations, and whether a given ID has been validated.
   Thanks to @fs0c131y for this one.
 * Don't send tracebacks to the browser when errors occur.
