Sydent purpose
==============

In you there is no need to install this component on your server. As an identity server, it is recommended to use matrix.org

You may need to install the sender, for example, if you deploy an isolated system and users will not be able to access the matrix.org

Installation
============

1. Ð¡heck that your system has ``sqlite3 >= 3.12`` (Otherwise there will be syntax errors when working with the database)

2. Run ``pip install https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/tarball/master``

3. Create user ``useradd -r matrix-sydent`` if not exists

4. ``cp sydent.example.conf /etc/matrix-synapse/sydent.conf`` and edit

5. Copy ``res\verify_response_page_template`` to verify_response_template path 

6. Copy ``res\verification_template.eml`` to email.template path

7. Check that pidfile.path writable by created ``matrix-sydent`` user (e.g. it not created with other owner when you test sydent)

8. Check that log.path exists and writable by created ``matrix-sydent`` user

9. Create sqlite database ``cat ./sydent/db/*.sql | sed 's/IF\sNOT\sEXISTS\s//i' | sqlite3 /var/lib/matrix-synapse/sydent.db``

10. Check that db.file writable by created ``matrix-sydent`` user

11. Check ownership ``chown -R matrix-synapse <path to templates>``

12. Check ownership ``chown -R matrix-synapse /etc/matrix-sydent/``

13. Config systemd ``cp /systemd/matrix-sydent.service /lib/systemd/system/`` and edit it: 

- check that WorkingDirectory exists and writable; 
- check that EnvironmentFile exists; 
- check that service will be run on behalf of the created user

14. After edit do not foget ``systemctl daemon-reload``

15. Start service with ``systemctl start matrix-sydent``


Run for test
============

Dependencies can be installed using setup.py in the same way as synapse: see synapse/README.rst.

Having installed dependencies, you can run sydent using::

    $ python -m sydent.sydent

This will create a configuration file in sydent.conf with some defaults. You'll most likely want to change the server name and specify a mail relay.

LDAP configuration
==================

See `<LDAP.rst>`_ for details.

Requests
========

The requests that synapse servers and clients submit to the identity server are, briefly, as follows:

Request the validation of your email address:

curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:8090/_matrix/identity/api/v1/validate/email/requestToken' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "matthew@arasphere.net", "client_secret": "abcd", "send_attempt": 1}'
{"success": true, "sid": "1"}

# receive 943258 by mail

Use this code to validate your email address:

curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:8090/_matrix/identity/api/v1/validate/email/submitToken' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token": "943258", "sid": "1", "client_secret": "abcd"}'
{"success": true}

Use the validated email address to bind it to a matrix ID:

curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:8090/_matrix/identity/api/v1/3pid/bind' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sid": "1", "client_secret": "abcd", "mxid": "%40matthew%3amatrix.org"}'

# lookup:

curl 'http://localhost:8090/_matrix/identity/api/v1/lookup?medium=email&address=henry%40matrix.org'

# fetch pubkey key for a server

curl http://localhost:8090/_matrix/identity/api/v1/pubkey/ed25519
