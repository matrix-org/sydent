About Matrix:

Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication
over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet
of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and
subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.

Matrix defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of
Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you
create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.
